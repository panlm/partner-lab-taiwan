Migrating a VM
++++++++++++++

In this portion of the lab we will configure source and target environments, create a migration plan, and finally perform a cutover operation.

Configuring Source and Target
.............................

In **Xtract**, click **+ Add Source Environment**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm08.png

- **Source Name** - Tech Summit 2018 vCenter
- **vCenter Server** - *<Source vCenter Server IP>*
- **User Name** - administrator@vsphere.local
- **Password** - *<vCenter Password>*

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm09.png

In **Xtract**, click **+ Add Target Environment**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm08.png

Creating a Migration Plan
.........................

In **Xtract**, click **Create a Migration Plan**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm12.png

Enter a **Migration Plan Name** and click **OK**:

- **Migration Plan Name** - ViewImage-Team-*<XX>* Migration.

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm13.png

Fill out the following fields and click **Next**:

- **Select Target** - *<Target Nutanix Cluster Name>*
- **Target Container** - Default

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm14.png

Select **ViewImage-Team-XX** VM and click **Next**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm15.png

Fill out the following fields and click **Next**:

- **Common Windows Credentials User Name** - administrator

Click **Save and Start**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm17.png

Monitor the status of the Migration Plan from the dashboard.

.. note::

  Clicking the **Status** link will display data migration progress and estimated time remaining for individual VMs.

  Migrations can also be paused or aborted via the Migration Plan **Action** menu.

Performing VM Cutover
.....................

Once the migration completes (**Migrated Data Size** should match **Data Size**), Xtract can perform a cutover operation to automatically shutdown the source VM and power on the migrated VM.

In **Xtract**, click **Migration In Progress** Status for your Migration Plan.

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm19.png

Select **ViewImage-Team-XX** and click **Cutover**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm20.png

Click **Continue**.

  .. figure:: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/s3.nutanixtechsummit.com/xtract-vm/xtractvm21.png

After the Cutover is completed you can launch Prism directly from Xtract to manage your migrated VM.

Takeaways
+++++++++

- Xtract for VMs simplifies bulk migration of existing VMs to Nutanix, eliminating the friction associated with onboarding new IT infrastructure.

- Businesses can quickly leverage the full potential of Nutanix Enterprise Cloud with near-zero VM downtime during the migration from vSphere ESXi to Nutanix AHV.

- Xtract features the ability to migrate all AHV certified OSes, scheduling data-seeding and migrations, multi-cluster migration management, and grouping/sorting VMs.

- Xtract is capable of maintaining MAC addresses and static IPs for migrated VMs.
